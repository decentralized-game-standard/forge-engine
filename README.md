# Forge-Engine

**A Modular Game Engine Ecosystem – Version 0.1 (Conceptual) – April 10, 2025**

Welcome to **Forge-Engine**, an open-source framework for building game engines from the ground up. Forget bloated, one-size-fits-all engines—this is about crafting lean, custom systems that fit your game like a glove. Inspired by POSIX’s small-tool philosophy and powered by a colored Petri net model, Forge-Engine lets you assemble tiny, focused components into the exact engine you need, whether it’s for a retro 2D scroller or a sprawling 3D epic.

*Note: This project is highly conceptual right now. It’s a foundation—a standard to explore and build on. No code yet, just a vision waiting for contributors to hammer it into shape.*

## What Is Forge-Engine?

Traditional engines like Unity or Unreal throw everything at you—physics, rendering, UI—whether you need it or not. Forge-Engine flips that script. Start with nothing, then add only the pieces your game demands. It’s built on a network of small processors that handle engine tasks—like binding buffers or drawing to the screen—connected through a flexible, data-driven flow.

Think of it as a toolbox for engine developers. Want a minimalist 2D renderer? Grab a few processors and wire them up. Need a full 3D pipeline with physics? Scale it out. Every component is modular, reusable, and yours to tweak.

## Why Forge-Engine?

- **No Bloat**: Include only what you need—no dead weight slowing you down.
- **Total Control**: Swap out a renderer or input system without cracking open a monolith.
- **Raw Performance**: Build tight, optimized engines tuned to your game’s DNA.
- **Community-Driven**: Open-source from day one—grow it with us.

This isn’t about pre-made games—it’s about crafting the machinery that powers them.

## How It Works: The Schema

Forge-Engine uses a colored Petri net model to manage data and tasks. Here’s the breakdown:

### Records
- **What**: Unique IDs for engine data containers.
- **Example**: `record1` might hold a 3D model’s info.
- **Purpose**: The “things” the engine tracks—neutral and game-agnostic.

### Fields
- **What**: Data tied to records—raw and simple.
- **Example**: `record1:field_buffer` (vertex data), `record1:field_transform` (matrix).
- **Purpose**: The payload processors work with.

### Places
- **What**: Queues where fields sit as tokens, waiting to be processed.
- **Example**: "buffer_queue" holds vertex buffers.
- **Purpose**: Staging areas for data flow.

### Processors
- **What**: Tiny units that do one engine job.
- **Example**: `processor_buffer_bind` binds a buffer, `processor_draw_call` renders it.
- **Purpose**: The workhorses—small, focused, and swappable.

### Tokens
- **What**: Fields moving through the system as data packets.
- **Example**: `record1:field_buffer` as a token in "buffer_queue."
- **Purpose**: Carry the data from place to processor.

### Networks
- **What**: Graphs of processors and places linked by data flows.
- **Example**: `processor_buffer_bind → processor_draw_call` for rendering.
- **Purpose**: Tie processors into subsystems like rendering or input.

### The Flow
1. Fields from records enter places as tokens.
2. Processors fire when their input places have tokens, process the data, and output new tokens.
3. Networks orchestrate this into parallel, efficient workflows.

It’s a dynamic system—processors run when data’s ready, not on a rigid clock, letting you harness concurrency naturally.

## Example: Rendering a 3D Model

Here’s a conceptual rendering pipeline to show Forge-Engine in action:

### Setup
- **Record**: `record1` (a 3D model).
- **Fields**:
  - `record1:field_buffer` (vertex data).
  - `record1:field_shader` (shader program).
  - `record1:field_transform` (transformation matrix).

### Places
- "buffer_queue": For `field_buffer` tokens.
- "shader_queue": For `field_shader` tokens.
- "transform_queue": For `field_transform` tokens.
- "bound_buffer_queue": Post-binding buffers.
- "bound_shader_queue": Post-binding shaders.
- "render_complete": Finished renders.

### Processors
- `processor_buffer_load`: Loads `field_buffer` into memory.
- `processor_buffer_bind`: Binds `field_buffer` to the GPU.
- `processor_shader_bind`: Attaches `field_shader`.
- `processor_draw_call`: Draws using all three fields.

### Flow
1. `record1:field_buffer` → "buffer_queue" → `processor_buffer_load` → "buffer_queue."
2. `processor_buffer_bind` grabs it → "bound_buffer_queue."
3. `record1:field_shader` → "shader_queue" → `processor_shader_bind` → "bound_shader_queue."
4. `record1:field_transform` → "transform_queue."
5. `processor_draw_call` waits for tokens in "bound_buffer_queue," "bound_shader_queue," and "transform_queue," then renders → "render_complete."

This is a barebones renderer—modular, extensible, and ready to scale.

## Goals and Intent

Forge-Engine aims to:
- **Empower Developers**: Build engines your way, not the engine’s way.
- **Optimize Performance**: Keep it lean with no forced overhead.
- **Foster Collaboration**: Grow a FOSS ecosystem where anyone can contribute processors or networks.

It’s not about being the flashiest tool—it’s about being the most practical one for engine tinkerers and game makers.

## Current State: Purely Conceptual

Right now, Forge-Engine is a blueprint—no code, no binaries, just ideas on paper (or pixels). This repo holds the standard’s vision, waiting for a community to breathe life into it. Think of it as a spec sheet for a dream engine—ready for prototyping, testing, and refining.

### What’s Next?
- **Proof of Concept**: A minimal renderer or input system to test the Petri net model.
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Can it hit 60 FPS with low overhead?
- **Community Input**: Your ideas on processors, networks, or optimizations.

## Get Involved

This is a FOSS project—your hands can shape it:
- **Read the Docs**: Start here to grok the concept.
- **Open an Issue**: Spot a flaw? Suggest a processor? Let’s talk.
- **Submit a PR**: Got a prototype or a new network design? Share it.

No pressure to jump in blind—lurk, think, then build when you’re ready.
