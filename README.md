Game engines are the foundational infrastructure of interactive software. Yet most are built as deeply intertwined monoliths where a change in one subsystem—renderer, physics, input—ripples into widespread breakage. Upgrading a graphics API can force a rewrite of core loops. Adding a feature risks polluting unrelated code. Performance bottlenecks hide behind inheritance hierarchies and virtual calls.

This rigidity is not inevitable. It arises from design choices that favor short-term convenience over explicit control and long-term evolvability.

GERS reimagines engine architecture as a neutral, data-flow substrate: every resource is a uniform Record, every operation is a small, stateless Processor that reads and writes Fields, and composition happens through explicit Networks of queued data. The result is an execution environment that evolves component-by-component without systemic collapse. Mods become native extensions. Obsolescence in one layer never dooms the whole. Diverse engines—from minimalist hobbyist builds to high-performance "pro" distributions—can emerge from the same standard, swapping components freely like Linux modules built by hundreds of contributors.

GERS is not a rule-description language or a specific game framework. It is the standardized "hardware + kernel" layer: the runtime that transforms data efficiently, leaving game-specific behaviors (core loops, win conditions, mechanics) to be implemented in swappable Processors and described separately via complementary standards.

## Diagnosing the Monolithic Trap

Dominant engines demonstrate both power and structural fragility:

- **Version Lock-In** — Projects stay pinned to old releases because upgrades break serialized data, plugins, or pipelines. Physics regressions, asset incompatibilities, and behavior shifts force delays or forks.
- **Abstraction Overhead** — Deep object hierarchies and virtual dispatch fragment data layout, causing cache misses that dominate frame time. A typical update loop scatters related data across unrelated objects, forcing pointer chasing instead of contiguous streaming.
- **Iteration Friction** — Compile times for trivial changes routinely exceed minutes, discouraging experimentation and deep optimization.
- **Hidden Dependencies** — Subsystems entangle silently. Input might touch rendering state. A plugin overriding one behavior can corrupt another. API deprecation (DirectX 11 → 12, OpenGL's decline) requires wholesale adaptation.
- **Modding as Afterthought** — Mods patch binaries or inject scripts, fragile against updates. Clean extension points are rare.

These issues compound because the engine owns too much—data, behavior, and execution are fused.

## Core Insight: Data Flow Over Control Flow

GERS draws from Unix pipes and data-oriented design: small transformations applied to explicit streams of well-layout data.

Everything is a **Record**: an opaque handle to a bundle of typed **Fields**. Meshes, entities, input state, framebuffers—all are Records. There is no inheritance; meaning emerges from the Fields present and the Processors that interpret them.

**Processors** are stateless functions that declare precise inputs and outputs:
- They read or query specific Fields from Records.
- They write or emit new Fields/Records.
- They contain no hidden state.

**Places** are typed queues decoupling producers from consumers, enabling safe concurrency.

A **Network** declaratively wires Processors via Places, defining the engine's topology.

This shifts the model from "objects sending messages" to "data flowing through transformations." Costs become explicit—no virtual calls masking cache thrashing, no accidental dependencies.

### Why This Enables Performance and Longevity

- **Cache Efficiency** — Processors querying related Fields (position + velocity) receive contiguous arrays naturally.
- **Parallelism** — Independent Processors fire simultaneously across cores; the runtime manages task graphs without manual locks.
- **Subsystem Swappability** — Replace a DirectX Renderer Processor with Vulkan; inputs/outputs remain identical.
- **Modding as Composition** — A mod author publishes a new Processor (advanced AI, custom physics) that slots into Networks at defined points.
- **Diverse Engines** — One minimal GERS build targets embedded devices; another optimizes for massive multiplayer; a third prioritizes high-fidelity rendering—all sharing the same Processor ecosystem.

## What GERS Deliberately Excludes

GERS is an execution substrate, not a game engine. Like POSIX defines OS interfaces without dictating implementation, GERS defines data-flow patterns without prescribing behavior:

| Excluded | Why | Where It Belongs |
|----------|-----|------------------|
| **Game logic** | Protocol defines flow, not rules | Processor implementations, Ludic Structures |
| **Specific engines** | Protocol enables composition, not distribution | Community builds, commercial offerings |
| **Networking/multiplayer** | Protocol is local-first | Transport layers, WOSS coordination |
| **Asset pipelines** | Protocol handles runtime, not authoring | Tool ecosystems |
| **Scheduling algorithms** | Protocol declares topology, not execution | Runtime implementations |

A GERS-conformant engine could be a minimal hobbyist runtime or a high-performance commercial product. The standard specifies the interface contract; everything else is competitive differentiation.

## Technical Foundations

### Record
Identifier referencing mutable or immutable data bundle.

```
record:player_42
  field:position    -> vec3
  field:velocity    -> vec3
  field:health      -> i32
  field:inventory   -> array<record>
```

Records carry data only—no embedded behavior.

### Field
Typed values attached to Records. Access is versioned or exclusive.

### Processor
Declares read/query/write signatures.

```
processor:integrate_motion
  reads:  [time.dt]
  queries: [position, velocity]
  writes: [position]
```

Implementation operates on bulk data in any supported language.

### Place
Typed queue of Records decoupling phases.

```
place:simulation_output -> place:render_input
```

### Network
Runtime-agnostic declaration (YAML-like):

```yaml
network: core_loop
  processors:
    - input_capture       -> place:input_events
    - motion_integration  -> place:physics_updates
    - collision_response  -> place:events
    - rendering           -> record:framebuffer
  schedule:
    - phase: input
    - phase: simulation [parallel]
    - phase: render
```

The runtime resolves dependencies and parallelizes phases.

### Concurrency Model
Petri-net inspired: Places hold tokens (Records), Processors fire when inputs available. Runtime handles scheduling—no manual threading.

### Standard Records
Minimal conventions for interoperability:

- `record:time` — dt, elapsed, fixed_step
- `record:input` — devices, events
- `record:frame` — output buffer
- `record:log` — diagnostics

## Integration with Broader Ecosystem

External entities (e.g., AEMS) map directly to Records. Manifestations guide Processor selection. Game rules described via complementary ludic structures are implemented in behavior Processors.

A modder funded externally can deliver a new Processor enhancing mechanics for specific entity types.

The engine remains agnostic to persistence and higher-level rules.

## Example: Minimal 2D Pipeline

```yaml
processors:
  - capture_input:
      writes: [record:input]
  - apply_forces:
      reads: [record:input, record:time]
      queries: [position, velocity, controller]
      writes: [velocity]
  - integrate_motion:
      reads: [record:time]
      queries: [position, velocity]
      writes: [position]
  - render_sprites:
      reads: [record:time]
      queries: [position, sprite, camera]
      writes: [record:frame]
```

Four focused components. Replace `render_sprites` with a 3D ray-traced variant—no ripple effects.

## Prototype Path

1. **Paper Design** — Map Records and Processors for a tiny game.
2. **Single-Thread Prototype** — Implement three Processors in any language, sequencing manually.
3. **Scheduler** — Add dependency resolution and phasing.
4. **Parallel Execution** — Introduce job system for concurrent phases.
5. **Ecosystem Growth** — Publish Processors for community reuse; build variant engines.

## Why Pursue This Now

Hardware favors wide, cache-coherent designs. Tools increasingly support data-oriented patterns. The costs of monolithic lock-in are evident in stalled projects and abandoned engines.

GERS is a pattern for engines that endure: explicit, measurable, replaceable—serving as the neutral substrate for diverse, evolving game experiences.

Experiment. Implement a single Processor. Watch how cleanly it composes.
